# Settings Integration Implementation

## Overview

Task 9 has been successfully implemented, providing real-time integration between settings changes and conflict detection system. This implementation ensures that when Zoom accounts are added or removed, the conflict detection system automatically updates and notifies users of any newly created conflicts.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Settings Integration Service (`src/services/settings-integration-service.ts`)

A comprehensive service that handles:
- **Real-time monitoring** of Zoom account changes
- **Capacity recalculation** when accounts are added/removed
- **Conflict notification system** for newly created conflicts
- **Event-driven architecture** with subscription support

Key features:
- Singleton pattern for consistent state management
- Automatic cache invalidation when settings change
- Periodic monitoring for external changes
- Notification queue management with size limits

### 2. API Endpoints

#### Conflict Notifications API (`src/app/api/conflict-notifications/route.ts`)
- `GET /api/conflict-notifications` - Retrieve current notification queue
- `POST /api/conflict-notifications` - Mark notifications as read or clear queue

#### Capacity Status API (`src/app/api/capacity-status/route.ts`)
- `GET /api/capacity-status` - Get current system capacity status
- `POST /api/capacity-status` - Force refresh capacity data (admin only)

### 3. Enhanced Zoom Accounts API Integration

Updated `src/app/api/zoom-accounts/route.ts` to:
- Notify settings integration service when accounts are added
- Trigger capacity recalculation on account removal
- Handle integration errors gracefully without failing requests

### 4. UI Integration Components

#### Settings Integration Initializer (`src/components/settings-integration-initializer.tsx`)
- Initializes the settings integration service on app startup
- Provides React hooks for accessing notifications and capacity status
- Shows toast notifications for real-time updates
- Handles service lifecycle management

#### Custom Hooks
- `useConflictNotifications()` - Access and manage conflict notifications
- `useCapacityStatus()` - Monitor system capacity in real-time

### 5. Enhanced Conflict Detection Integration

Updated `src/services/enhanced-conflict-detection.ts` to:
- Include Zoom capacity validation in meeting validation
- Integrate with zoom account service for real-time capacity checks
- Provide detailed conflict information with suggestions

## Real-time Features

### 1. Automatic Capacity Updates
- When Zoom accounts are added/removed, capacity is automatically recalculated
- All active conflict detection processes are notified of changes
- Cache is invalidated to ensure fresh data

### 2. Conflict Notifications
- When capacity is reduced, existing meetings are re-validated
- New conflicts are automatically detected and queued as notifications
- Users receive toast notifications for immediate awareness
- Notification queue is managed with size limits and read status

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
- Settings changes emit events that other services can subscribe to
- Capacity updates trigger re-validation of existing meetings
- Real-time UI updates without page refresh

## Integration Points

### 1. Application Layout
The `SettingsIntegrationInitializer` is integrated into the main app layout (`src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`) to ensure:
- Service initialization on app startup
- Real-time notification handling
- Proper cleanup on app shutdown

### 2. Meeting Form Integration
The meeting form continues to use the enhanced conflict detection service, which now includes:
- Real-time Zoom capacity validation
- Integration with settings changes
- Automatic conflict updates when capacity changes

### 3. Type Safety
All new functionality is fully typed with TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/conflict-detection.ts`:
- `SettingsIntegrationService` interface
- `ConflictNotification` type
- `CapacityUpdateEvent` type
- `SettingsChangeEvent` type

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite implemented in `src/services/__tests__/settings-integration-service.test.ts`:
- Service initialization testing
- Zoom account change handling
- Capacity status management
- Notification queue functionality
- Error handling scenarios

All tests pass successfully with good coverage.

## Usage Examples

### Subscribing to Capacity Updates
```typescript
import { settingsIntegrationService } from '@/services/settings-integration-service'

settingsIntegrationService.subscribeToCapacityUpdates((event) => {
  console.log(`Capacity updated: ${event.newCapacity} total slots`)
})
```

### Using React Hooks
```typescript
import { useCapacityStatus, useConflictNotifications } from '@/components/settings-integration-initializer'

function MyComponent() {
  const { capacityStatus, forceRefresh } = useCapacityStatus()
  const { notifications, markAsRead } = useConflictNotifications()
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Available slots: {capacityStatus.availableSlots}</p>
      <p>Unread notifications: {notifications.filter(n => !n.isRead).length}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **6.1** - Connect conflict detection to Zoom account settings changes
✅ **6.2** - Add real-time updates when accounts are added/removed  
✅ **6.3** - Implement capacity recalculation on settings changes
✅ **6.4** - Add notification system for newly created conflicts

The implementation provides a robust, real-time system that ensures users are immediately aware of any conflicts that arise from changes to Zoom account configuration, maintaining system reliability and user experience.
