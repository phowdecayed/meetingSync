# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the layout and user experience of the public calendar component (`src/components/public-calendar.tsx`). The current implementation uses a basic list view with FullCalendar, but we want to enhance it with a more modern, responsive, and visually appealing layout that better showcases meeting information and provides improved usability for public viewing scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a public viewer, I want to see meetings in a more visually organized layout, so that I can quickly scan and understand the meeting schedule at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the public calendar loads THEN the system SHALL display meetings in a grid or card-based layout instead of a simple list
2. WHEN viewing meeting cards THEN each card SHALL prominently display the meeting title, time, status, and key details
3. WHEN multiple meetings exist THEN the system SHALL organize them in a responsive grid that adapts to different screen sizes
4. WHEN meetings have different statuses THEN the system SHALL use visual indicators (colors, badges) to distinguish between upcoming, ongoing, and completed meetings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a public viewer, I want better visual hierarchy and information organization, so that I can easily identify the most important meeting details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a meeting card THEN the system SHALL display meeting information with clear visual hierarchy (title > time > details)
2. WHEN a meeting is currently ongoing THEN the system SHALL highlight it with distinctive styling
3. WHEN viewing meeting details THEN the system SHALL group related information logically (basic info, participants, location/meeting ID)
4. WHEN meetings have descriptions THEN the system SHALL display them in a readable format with appropriate truncation if needed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a public viewer, I want improved navigation and filtering options, so that I can find relevant meetings more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the calendar THEN the system SHALL provide easy navigation between different time periods (today, this week, next week)
2. WHEN multiple meeting types exist THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by meeting type (internal/external)
3. WHEN meetings span multiple days THEN the system SHALL provide clear date grouping or section headers
4. WHEN searching for specific meetings THEN the system SHALL provide a search or filter functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a public viewer using different devices, I want the calendar to work well on mobile, tablet, and desktop, so that I can access meeting information from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display meetings in a single column layout with touch-friendly interactions
2. WHEN viewing on tablets THEN the system SHALL display meetings in a 2-3 column grid layout
3. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the system SHALL utilize the full screen width with an appropriate multi-column layout
4. WHEN switching between devices THEN the system SHALL maintain functionality and readability across all screen sizes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a public viewer, I want enhanced visual design and modern UI elements, so that the calendar feels professional and easy to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the calendar THEN the system SHALL use modern design patterns with appropriate spacing, typography, and color schemes
2. WHEN interacting with elements THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations and transitions
3. WHEN viewing in different themes THEN the system SHALL support both light and dark mode with appropriate contrast
